## Requirements
You only need Java SDK (16 minmum) for the game : https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/downloads/  
Just use the .jar file or the .exe file and double click.  
If you don't download the full repository, **you need to take resources folder too!** This folder must be placed right besides the .jar or the .exe file.  

## Notes
Note: The app uses **NORM** SQL implementation (Copyright 2014, Dieselpoint, Inc. under Apache License v2.0).  
Pong based on Gaspared's and William's codes, and Flappy on Mompi's and Pinkman's games.  
Leaderboard displays **even scores** based on your id or your name, so the sorting a visiter sees may vary **in this case**.
