This app runs games and saves your best scores into a database. No special config needed.  
Stats are now displayed on the web!

Contact me here for any question or request.

## Requirements
Please install Java SDK 16 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
or JRE 8 minimum, which is lighter: https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html.  
Just use the .jar file or the .exe file and double click.  
If you don't download the full repository, **you need to take resources folder too!** They must be placed right besides the .jar or the .exe file.  

## Notes
Note: The app uses **NORM** SQL implementation (Copyright 2014, Dieselpoint, Inc. under Apache License v2.0).  
Pong based on Gaspared's and William's codes, and Flappy on Mompi's and Pinkman's games.  
Leaderboard displays even scores based on your id or your name, so it may vary in this case.
